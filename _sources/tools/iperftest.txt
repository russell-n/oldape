The Iperf Test
==============

A module to hold an iperf test tool.



.. currentmodule:: apetools.tools.iperftest

Errors
------

The `IperfTestError` is raised if there was an iperf-related error (as opposed to, say, a connection-related error).

.. uml::

   IperfTestError -|> CommandError



.. _iperf-test:

The Iperf Test
--------------

The `IperfTest` runs a single test, taking care of both sides of the connection (client and server).

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   IperfTest

.. uml::

   IperfTest -|> BaseClass
   IperfTest o--  IperfCommand
   IperfTest o-- Sleep
   IperfTest o-- Kill
   IperfTest : sender_command
   IperfTest : receiver_command
   IperfTest : sleep
   IperfTest : wait_events
   IperfTest : kill
   
* :ref:`IperfCommand <iperf-command>` runs the actual iperf-commands

* :ref:`Sleep <apetools-tools-sleep>` provides a sleep after the server is started so the client does not start too soon

* :ref:`Kill <apetools-tools-killall>` is used to kill all pre-existing iperf-sessions.

Example Use::

   test = IperfTest(iperf_client_command, iperf_server_command)
   test(node, traffic_pc, 'output_file')

* The `iperf_client_command` and `iperf_server_command` are :ref:`IperfCommands <iperf-command>`.

* The `node` and `traffic_pc` are :ref:`Devices <base-device>`
   


The Call
--------

The main interface with the `IperfTest` is its call-method::

   test = IperfTest(sender_command, receiver_command)
   test(sender, receiver, filename)

The process:

   #. Set the target address in the iperf command to the receiver (server)::
   
        self.sender_command.parameters.client = receiver.address

   #. Kill the existing iperf processes::
   
        self.kill(sender.connection)
        self.kill(receiver.connection)
   
   #. Start the iperf-server and sleep to let it get set-up::
   
        self.receiver_command.start(receiver, filename)   
        self.sleep()

   #. Allow other processes to block the iperf client-start
   
        if self.wait_events is not None:
            time_out = self.sender_command.max_time
            if not self.wait_events.wait(time_out):
                raise IperfTestError("Timed out waiting for event.")                

   #. Run the client
   
        self.sender_command.run(sender, filename)

   #. Check if the server is still running and kill it if it is::
   
        if self.receiver_command.running:
            self.kill(receiver.connection)

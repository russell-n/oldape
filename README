The `APE` is an attempt at a swiss-army knife style of test-runner, which uses a configuration file (`ini`) to declare both the parts of the test to be executed and the parameters those parts need. Additionally, it accepts a `glob <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>`_ so that separate configurations can be executed in lexicographic order.

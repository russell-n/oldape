Assertions
==========

A set of assertion functions to make the messages a little easier. I don't really know what the use case is here. I think this is leftover from when I wasn't using UnitTest or pyhamcrest as much.

.. module:: apetools.commons.assertions
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: api

   assert_equal
   assert_is
